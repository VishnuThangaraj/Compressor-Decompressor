# Java Swing Compressor and Decompressor

This is a simple Java Swing application that allows you to compress and decompress files using the GZIP compression algorithm. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting files to compress and decompress, making it easy for users to work with compressed files.

## Features

- Compress files using GZIP compression.
- Decompress GZIP compressed files.
- Intuitive graphical user interface.
- Easy file selection with a file picker dialog.
- Progress indicator for compression and decompression operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this application, you need to have the following software installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java SE Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
